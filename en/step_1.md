## Introduction

In this project, you will create a 15 second animation of an egg cracking to reveal a surprise! The animation will be played on the LED matrix of the SenseHAT.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Animation</span> is the rapid swapping of still images (frames) to trick the brain into thinking the image is moving. Each image will have a small change so when shown in a sequence they create the appearance of a moving picture. Some animations are short clips but others can be long animated movies.
</p>

You will:
+ Create an image using the LED matrix
+ Create a frame by frame animation using the LED matrix
+ Introduce a loop to repeat the animation three times

You will need:
+ A web browser for the SenseHAT emulator

Optional:
+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ A SenseHAT
