A CoderDojo ninja wants to create an animation that is **10 seconds** long. They have **5 frames** and each frame is displayed for **1 second**. 

How many times should the animation repeat to make it 10 seconds long? 

--- choices ---

- ( ) It doesn't need to be repeated because it will already be 10 seconds long.

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. The animation has **5 frames**. Each frame is displayed for **1 second**. **5 x 1 = 5 seconds**. This would be too short. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Twice

  --- feedback ---

Perfect! You are correct! The animation has **5 frames**. Each frame is displayed for **1 second**. **5 x 2 = 10 seconds**. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Three times

  --- feedback ---

Try again. The animation has **5 frames**. Each frame is displayed for **1 second**. **5 x 3 = 15 seconds**. This would make the animation too long.
